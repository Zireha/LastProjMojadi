# Mojadi Last Proj


This repository contains all files used to fulfill my final project on Mojadiapp Independent Study.
This project is about creating melanoma detection using a Convolutional Neural Network deep learning model.
The app is deployed on https://zirehamelanomadetection.streamlit.app/ but is currently not accessible due to bandwidth usage of git LFS.
